# Project-06-Costumer-Churn
The goal of this work is to predict if the custumers will cancel their subscription plan or not.

# About me:
My name is Dener, Brazilian, 24 years old, and I have studied data science since the beggining of 2020. I'm a hard-working student, always wanting to learn more and more, that's why I decided to start doing my projects, because in my opinion, that's one of the best ways to improve our skills, by doing real projects, with real work problems that the companies have faced nowadays.

I hope you like to read my codes, as well as I enjoyed to write them.
